GettingAndCleaningData_1
========================

First assigment for GettingAndCleaningData coursera course

The first things the script do is read input (x) data from test and training set and rbind them. Next do the same with activity (y) data.
Reads the labels files for input columns and activity values in order to put nice text in the dataframe.
Create index of columns with mean or std in the column name in order to keep only the relevant data.
Last thing is for each column and each activity value keep the mean in other dataframe. Once created the means dataframe it just save it in a file in order to upload it.

NOTE: I have not uploaded the original data files to github to keep it simple.
